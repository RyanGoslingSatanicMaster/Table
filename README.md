# TimeTable Application for Kuban State Agrarian University
This is my portfolio project which developed and designed by me.

TimeTable App is most comfortable and powerful application for view your class schedule, if you student of KubSAU of course. Application parse and save schedule information from https://s.kubsau.ru/.
P.S. KubSAU server haven't convenient API. So, we need to parse Html-code.


So, there're some main advantages of TimeTable App:

1. <strong>All schedule data saves LOCAL</strong>
2. <strong>Custom Design with Day/Night Mode</strong>
